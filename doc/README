To build the .dvi files for the documentation. type "make".

This will build both the full design document ngc_proposed_design.dvi
and the API's only portion of that mct_APIs.dvi

To build just the design doc, type "make design"
To build just the APIs, type "make apis"

NOTE:  this build system isn't working perfectly yet.  It will
build a .dvi file but you will need to run "bibtex" manually to
build the bibliography.

To build "by hand" using the design doc as an example:
cd to texsrc, type "make"
cd back do doc directory then do:

latex ngc_proposed_design
bibtex ngc_proposed_design
latex ngc_proposed_design
latex ngc_proposed_design

Similarily for the APIs document
