\begin{abstract}
In this document we describe the design of the Model Coupling
Toolkit (MCT).   The MCT was created in response to the requirements
of the new coupler for the NCAR Community Climate System Model.
Analysis of the coupler's requirements lead us to a layered
design capable of supporting the coupler's high-level
command/control functions and its relatively low-level grid
transformation and physics calculation functions.  The
Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) is designed to handle the low-level
functions.  We describe in detail the
design of the MCT, and how one might use it to build the NGC.

\section{Introduction}

The goal of the Accelerated Climate Prediction Initiative (ACPI)
Avant Garde Project is to construct a performance-portable
version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).  This new
model is to be built using solid software design and engineering
practices.  The CCSM marks the merger of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model (CSM) with the
Parallel Climate Model (PCM).   One of the chief design
challenges for the CCSM is the flux coupler, which was 
nicknamed {\em the Next-Generation Coupler} (NGC) and will
eventually be called cpl6.

The NGC is expected to increase dramatically the flexibility of
the CCSM, and expand correspondingly the variety of research
possible using this model.

[more verbiage here about how the problem has been solved in the
past, and the pitfalls of each approach]

In section \ref{sec-req} we summarize and analyze the requirements
for the NGC.  In section \ref{sec-arch} we
state the overall design of the coupler and the role for
the Model Coupling Toolkit.  In section \ref{sec-mct} we
describe the Model Coupling Toolkit.  In section
\ref{sec-mct-app} we demonstrate how one can build couplers using
the toolkit.

\section{Requirements for the Next-Generation Coupler}\label{sec-req}

\subsection{Review of NGC Requirements}

A full statement of the requirements for the NGC are given at the
URL
\begin{verbatim}
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/csm/models/cpl-ng/#requirements
\end{verbatim}

Two types of requirements were identified---{\em scientific
requirements} and {\em computational functionality requirements}.
The scientific requirements outline the coupler's role in the
coupled modeling system, and a list of the core functions the
coupler must provide.  The computational functionality
requirements outline the programming language(s) to which the
coupler must provide interfaces, and portability and performance
issues.

The scientific requirements are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The coupler must provide overall control of the coupled
model system;
\item The coupler must perform an a system-wide coherence check to
ensure the component models are configured and initialized
properly;
\item The coupler must be sufficiently flexible to allow new/improved 
component models to be substituted for the existing component models in a
straightforward manner;
\item The coupler must be extensible, allowing the user to modify
the fields or amounts of data exchanged via the coupler to be
changed with ease, and to add new component models;
\item The coupler must be able to support coupling of models run
either asynchronously, or as an event loop;
\item The coupler must support the following computations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item calculation of interfacial physics fluxes;
\item mapping and transformation of data between different
component model grids;
\item merging of interfacial fluxes supplied by multiple component
models for delivery to another component model;
\item time accumulation and averaging of flux and state
variables;
\item diagnostic quantities such as spatial and temporal averages
of fluxes and state variables exchanged between component models;
\end{enumerate}
\item The coupler is must be able to receive, process, and deliver
data on a variety of grids, including unstructured grids, and the
coupler must be able to handle masked areas on these grids.
\end{enumerate}

The computational functionality requirements are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The coupler must be portable to a number of platforms, primarily
clusters of RISC-based multiprocessors and purely
distributed-memory multiprocessors.
\item The coupler, and any special-purpose libraries written for
it must at the minimum provide a fortran 90 API.  All flux physics
packages for the coupler must be written in f90.
\item The coupler must support the following parallel paradigms:  
pure shared-
memory parallelism; pure message-passing parallelism; hybrid
parallelism incorporating threading on multiprocessor nodes and
message passing between multiprocessor nodes.
\item The coupler must provide the option to achieve bit-for-bit
reproducibility in the parallel modes described above if run on
the same platform with fixed system configuration and input data,
and  with the same number of processors.
\item The coupler functions must be capable of supporting either
event-loop or asynchronous coupling of component models.
\item The coupler must at the minimum meet the performance of the
flux couplers present in the CSM version 1.2 and PCM version 1.0.
\item The coupler must accomodate either single or multiple
executable image architectures of the coupled modeling system.
\item The coupler's parallel algorithms must be capable of running
on any number of processors ({\em i.e.}, no power-of-two
algorithms).
\item Only communincations between the coupler and the component
models is permitted.
\item The regridding operations in the coupler must be capable of
performing efficiently arbitrary, masked regriddings using
transformation matrices.
\item The coupler must be capable of reading and writing both
history and restart data.
\item The coupler must provide some error-handling support, and be
capable of shutting down all of the coupled system's component
models.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussion of the Requirements}

Analysis of the two groups of requirements outlined in the
previous section yields some broad conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The coupler has both high-level command/control and
low-level functions.  There are distinct parts of the coupler
that must know considerable detail about each of the component
models, and other portions (e.g., the matrix-vector
multiplication, time-averaging and flux-merging routines) that
need little knowledge of the individual components.  This
suggests a layered design strategy.
\item the requirement that the coupler be capable of supporting
both event-loop coupling (e.g. the Parallel Climate Model) and
asynchronous coupling (e.g. the Climate System Model) suggests the
need to implement the coupler as one or more libraries that
support the construction either type of coupler.
\item There is no requirement to support regridding of data on
three-dimensional grids.  For this initial version of the
coupler, we shall implement regridding of data on two-dimensional
grids, but will not take steps to restrict the software to only
two-dimensional grids.
\item The grid interpolation will be implemented as a matrix-vector 
multiply, with the matrix elements generated using the Los Alamos
Spherical Coordinate Remapping and Interpolation Package (SCRIP) 
\footnote{Information about SCRIP is available on-line at 
http://climate.acl.lanl.gov/software/SCRIP} \cite{jones-1999}.  Given
the fact that SCRIP not parallel software, these weights will be 
generated off-line.
\item There is a demand that the coupler and all its utility routines
provide a Fortran 90 API, and that the flux physics routines be
written in Fortran 90.  This suggests it might be easiest to
implement the coupler in Fortran 90.
\item The requirement for flexibility in the fields passed to the
coupler, and extensibility to incorporate new component models
with ease suggest the need for the coupler to have an internal
data representation such as a Fortran 90 derived type.
\item The requirement that the coupler be capable of receiving and
delivering data on numerous grids, including unstructured grids
suggests the coupler needs its own general scheme for describing
gridded data.  For now, this scheme
\item The requirement that all component models communicate via
the coupler could create a system bottleneck.  For the sake of
performance, the communications between component models and the
coupler must be implemented in parallel; i.e. an M to N transfer
rather than the current gather-send-scatter approach currently
used in CSM and PCM.
\end{enumerate}

Based on these conclusions, it is clear that the best design
strategy a set of tools or libraries that can be used to create a
wide variety of coupler applications.



\section{Overall Architecture of the NGC}\label{sec-arch}

The overall coupler architecture is a layered design.  The Layers
(Figure \ref{fig:coupler-layers}), ranked lowest-level to
highest-level are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Layer 1:  Vendor Utilities}---these are either standard
libraries, or vendor-supplied or vendor-supplied utilities.  These
libraries currently include the Message-Passing Interface (MPI)
library, vendor-supplied shared-memory primitives ({\em e.g.},
SHMEM), and the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) library.
\item {\bf Layer 2:  Parallel Environment Utilities}---these utilities provide
module access to MPI, and support for error-handling, diagnostic
output, and run-time input of resources for the coupler.  This
layer also supplies some of the classes used to build the basic
coupler data classes.  Currently, this layer is served by the
NASA Data Assimilation Office's Message Passing Environment
Utilities (mpeu) library.
\item {\bf Layer 3:  Basic Coupler Classes and Methods}---the internal
data representation and data decomposition for the coupler, and
will be discussed in more detail in section \ref{sec-mct-base}.
\item {\bf Layer 4:  Derived Coupler Classes and Methods}---this layer includes
datatypes and routines to support:  interpolation implemented as
sparse matrix-vector multiplication; time averaging; computation
of fluxes from state variables.
\item {\bf Layer 5:  Coupler Applications}---the layer in which couplers
are built from lower-layer utilities.  Applications in this layer
have information regarding the data types and data decompositions
used by the component models being coupled.  This layer includes
utilities for packing (unpacking) messages sent to (received from)
the coupler or between component models, and the utilities that
communicate with the coupler or between component models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interfaces to the Coupler}

\subsection{Assignment of models to processors}

[Ed. comment--for now, much of what Chris has done can go here]

\subsection{Contracts}

Coupling between any two component models is described by one or
more {\tt contracts}.  For example, direct coupling between the
atmosphere and ocean requires that the atmosphere deliver to the
ocean at certain times a set of fields, and that atmosphere
receive from the ocean at certain times a set of fields.  Each of
these operations can be described using the {\tt Contract}
datatype:

\begin{verbatim}
Type Contract
  logical       :: new
  type(String)  :: partner
  type(String)  :: operation
  integer       :: frequency
  type(GlobalSegMap) :: remote_map
  type(LocalSegMap)  :: local_map
End Type Contract
\end{verbatim}

The quantity {\tt Contract\%new} is a logical flag, which, if
true, requires the initialization (or re-initialization) of the
local and remote data decomposition descriptors {\tt
Contract\%local\_map} and {\tt Contract\%remote\_map},
respectively. These data decomposition descriptors are defined is
section BLAH.  The string variable {\tt partner} indicates which
component model is being coupled ({\em e.g.}, {\tt "OCEAN", "SEA
ICE", "ATMOSPHERE", "LAND", "RIVER"}) , and {\tt operation} is
has value either {\tt "SEND"} or {\tt "RECEIVE"}.

Each component model creates a collection of contracts, and at
each timestep examines the collection of contracts to see what
data must be sent (received) to (from) other component models or
the coupler.  The contracts are also examined to determine which
partners have changed data decomposition, which requires
re-initialization of {\tt Contract\%remote\_map}.  If the
component model's data decomposition changes, this change is
reflected in a change to {\tt Contract\%local\_map}, and this
change will be posted to the partner.

\section{The Model Coupling Toolkit}\label{sec-mct}

\subsection{Internal Data Representation}\label{sec-mct-base}

In both PCM and CSM, the flux coupler uses a real vector to
represent each field, and these vectors are bundled into
two-dimensional real arrays.  Each time a new field is added to
the PCM or CSM coupler, the dimensions of these arrays must be
changed, and any indexing to reference fields must be extended.
This is at the least an impediment to rapid substitution of
component models.

To simplify this process, the coupler has its own internal data
representation that is extremely flexible.  This data structure
is a bundle of vectors, indexed by a character list, and called an
{\em Attribute Vector}, or {\tt AttrVect}.  The {\tt AttrVect},
implemented in Fortran 90 is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
Type AttrVect
  type(List) :: iList
  type(List) :: rList
  real, dimension(:,:), pointer :: iAttr
  real, dimension(:,:), pointer :: rAttr
End Type AttrVect
\end{verbatim}

An {\tt AttrVect} has a list of real and integer attributes. The
syntax of a list is a string delimited by colons.  For an {\tt
AttrVect} variable {\tt av} list of real and integer attributes
are contained in the lists {\tt av\%rList} and {\tt av\%iList},
respectively.  The real and integer data are referenced via the
pointers {\tt av\%rAttr} and {\tt av\%iAttr}, respectively. For
example, the latitudes and longitudes of a set of locations could
be stored in {\tt AttrVect} variable {\tt locations}, with {\tt
location\%rList = 'latitude:longitude'}.

The {\tt AttrVect} class has many methods, including:  numerous
versions of a create method; destroy; return the vector length
with the method {\tt lsize}; return the number of integer and real
attributes with the methods {\tt nRA} and {\tt nIA} respectively;
indexing of real (integer) attributes with the methods {\tt
indexRA} and {\tt indexIA}, respectively.

How data referenced by the pointers {\tt rAttr} and {\tt iAttr}
are accessed can be understood by returning to our example {\tt
AttrVect} variable {\tt locations} mentioned above.  Suppose we
wish to access the latitude and longitude data in {\tt locations}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item One determines the index values for latitude and
longitude---{\tt ilat} and {\tt ilon}, respectively--through the
method {\tt indexRA}:
\begin{verbatim}
ilat = indexRA(locations,'latitude')

ilon = indexRA(locations,'longitude')
\end{verbatim}
\item the vector of latitudes is {\tt locations\%rAttr(ilat,:)},
and the vector of longitudes is {\tt locations\%rAttr(ilon,:)}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Decomposition Descriptors}

If we represent two-dimensional grids as vectors of their
gridpoints' cooridinates, we have must have a some way to
describe their decompositions.  Two mechanisms are available in
the MCT:  a {\tt LocalSegMap}, which lists how many segments, and
which segments of a decomposed global vector reside on the local
processor; a {\tt GlobalSegMap} which lists how many segments, and
which segments of a decomposed global vector (with some assumed
coordinate ordering) resides on each processor in the
decomposition.

The {\tt LocalSegMap} type is defined as
\begin{verbatim}
Type LocalSegMap
  integer               :: nseg
  integer, dimension(:) :: llc
  integer, dimension(:) :: lln
  integer, dimension(:) :: glc
End Type LocalSegMap
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt GlobalSegMap} type is defined as
\begin{verbatim}
Type GlobalSegMap
  type(communicator)    :: comm
  integer               :: ngseg
  integer, dimension(:) :: lc
  integer, dimension(:) :: ln
  integer, dimension(:) :: pe_loc
End Type GlobalSegMap
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Derived Classes and Methods}

\subsubsection{Grids}

The most general type of grid in two dimensions is a set of points
with a list of their coordinates.  Recalling our {\tt AttrVect}
example from the previous section, we can describe a
two-dimensional grid in a variety of ways, the most general of
which is to list explicitly all the latitudes and longitudes.  The
{\tt GeneralGrid} type is defined as
\begin{verbatim}
Type GeneralGrid
  type(List)     :: ordering
  type(AttrVect) :: points
End Type GeneralGrid
\end{verbatim}
where the list{\tt GeneralGrid\%ordering} signifies the sorting
order that unravels the multidimensional grid into a vector of
grid points.  The {\tt AttrVect} component {\tt
GeneralGrid\%points} is a list of the grid points.  Consider a
two-dimensional atmosphere latitude-longitude grid {\tt
atm\_latlon} whose points are sorted in lexicographic order by
latitude and longitude, and numbered accordingly:
\begin{verbatim}
Type (GeneralGrid} :: atm_latlon

atm_latlon%ordering = "latitude:longitude"
atm_latlon%points%rList = "latitude:longitude"
atm_latlon%points%iList = "index1d"

\end{verbatim}

When a {\tt GeneralGrid} type is initialized with sets of points,
and the list of coordinates, the list {\tt GeneralGrid\%ordering}
can be compared with the list {\tt GeneralGrid\%rAttr} to ensure
the lists contain the same components, and the {\tt AttrVect}
sorting methods can be used to sort the grid points in {\tt
GeneralGrid\%points\%rAttr} in the appropriate lexicographic
order, and then register their grid point index number in {\tt
GeneralGrid\%points\%iAttr}.

\subsubsection{Transformations and Sparse Matrices}

The transformation from one grid to another will initially be
implemented as a sparse matrix-vector multiplication.  The
parameters of the transformation will be stored in the a datatype
called the {\tt SparseMatrix}.

The {\tt SparseMatrix} class is a special instantiation of the
{\tt AttrVect} class.  The sparse matrix is a set of one or more
weights identified with a list of row and column indices.  That
is, a sparse matrix will have one or more real attributes and a
fixed list of two integer attributes.  An example of a {\tt
SparseMatrix} structure {\tt A2O\_mat} with one real interpolation
weight is shown below:
\begin{verbatim}
(type) SparseMatrix :: A2O_mat
A2O_mat%iList = 'row:column'
A2O_mat%rList = 'weight'
\end{verbatim}

Transformations will be generated using an algorithm such as that
in SCRIP.  In the early development stages of the coupler, this
will be done off-line, and the {\tt SparseMatrix} corresponding
to a given grid transformation will be read from an input file.

In more mature versions of the MCT, this capability will be
supplied on-line as a call to {\tt GenerateTransform}:
\begin{verbatim}
call GenerateTransform(SourceGrid, DestGrid, Transform, status)
\end{verbatim}
where the input arguments {\tt SourceGrid} and {\tt DestGrid} are
the {\tt GeneralGrid} representations of the source and
destination grids, respectively, the output argument{\tt
Transform} is a {\tt SparseMatrix} type, and the integer output
argument {\tt status} is an error flag (zero if the operation was
successful).

\subsubsection{The Accumulator}

The {\tt Accumulator} is a the data class used to compute running
sums for time averages required by the coupler.

\begin{verbatim}
Type Accumulator
  integer :: num_steps
  integer :: steps_done
  type(AttrVect) :: av
End Type Accumulator
\end{verbatim}

Consider as an example the {\tt Accumulator} variable {\tt sum}.
The integer {\tt sum\%num\_steps} is the number of steps in the
averaging cycle, and {\tt sum\%steps\_done} is the number of steps
completed in the averaging cycle.  The accumulated data is stored
in the {\tt AttrVect} structure {\tt sum\%av}.  The {\tt
Accumulator} class shares some of the create, destroy, size, and
index methods associated with the {\tt AttrVect} class. Data from
an {\tt AttrVect} is added to an {\tt Accumulator} using the
method {\tt Accumulate}, which is implemented in Fortran 90 as a
subroutine call:
\begin{verbatim}
call Accumulate(av, sum, status)
\end{verbatim}
The input variable {\tt av} is an {\tt AttrVect} type, the
input/output variable {\tt sum} is an {\tt Accumulator} type, and
{\tt status} is an integer error flag (value zero if the call was
successful).

\subsubsection{Merging of Fluxes}

\subsection{Message-Passing Environment Utilities Library}

The Message Passing Environment Utilities (MPEU) library was
developed by the NASA Data Assimilaiton Office (DAO) to support
the development of a message-passing parallel version of their
Physical-space Statistical Analysis System (PSAS).  The library
is same-source parallel in the sense that one body of source code
is used to construct both a parallel and sequential version of
the utilities.

The mpeu library provides the following services:
\begin{itemize}
\item F90 Module-style access to MPI, including a scheme to make
communication calls independent of the underlying variable type
representation (e.g. 32 vs. 64 bit reals)
\item Support for {\tt stdout} and {\tt stderr} devices for multiple processors
\item Exception handling/soft landing--something to shut down things
with at least a short comment describing why  (and yes, this will
allow any component to shut down all the components).
\item Timing tools that use string tags to identify timers, and also provide
three measures of load imbalance
\item Allocatable memory accounting tools
\item Support for an alternative to namelist files called
"resource files."  This allows one pe to do file input,
distribute the contents of the resource file, and all the pe's to
have random access to its contents.  There's support for loading
tables under this scheme as well.
\item Support for some basic data types that are required by the
AttrVect data type (which is the coupler's internal data
representation)
\item Sorting tools
\item I/O utilities for allocating fortran i/o device numbers from
a stack.  This way, you don't need to dig around in all the source
code to worry about what device numbers are already spoken for by
another subroutine or component model.
\end{itemize}

The mpeu software is highly portable, and runs on a large number
of platforms (including linux).  It is also
"single-source-parallel" in the sense that it can be used to
create parallel versions of all the tools described above, or
sequential versions where appropriate.  Also, the library is self-
documenting, and LaTeX files can be generated from the code using
ProTeX.
