\begin{abstract}
In this document we state the Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
 for the model coupling toolkit (mct), which has been proposed as
a set of components to implement the Next-Generation
Coupler (NGC) for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).
Analysis of the Coupler's requirements lead us to a layered
design capable of supporting the coupler's high-level
command/control functions and its relatively low-level grid
transformation and physics calculation functions.  This design
and the concept of a Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) were introduced 
in the NGC proposed design document.

\part{What is the Model Coupling Toolkit?}

\section{Introduction}

The goal of the Accelerated Climate Prediction Initiative (ACPI)
Avant Garde Project is to construct a performance-portable
version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).  This new
model is to be built using solid software design and engineering
practices.  The CCSM marks the merger of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model (CSM) with the
Parallel Climate Model (PCM).   One of the chief design
challenges for the CCSM is the flux coupler, which has been
nicknamed {\em the Next-Generation Coupler} (NGC).

The NGC is expected to increase dramatically the flexibility of
the CCSM, and expand correspondingly the variety of research
possible using this model.  The NGC will be constructed using 
components in the mct.

In the design document, we outlined a layered design for the 
NGC (Figure \ref{fig:coupler-layers}).  Here we state in detail 
the API's for layers three and four of this design, which comprise 
the mct.

\section{Level 3 Classes and Methods}
The lowest level of the toolkit is the definition of the internal 
data representation of the coupler (the {\tt AttrVect}), two simple 
schemes for one-and-two dimensional data decompositions (the 
{\tt GlobalMap} and {\tt GlobalSegMap} respectively), and indexing 
of local data ({\tt the Navigator}).  In addition to these basic 
classes, some simple, collective communications methods are defined
for the {\tt AttrVect} component.

\section{Level Classes and Methods 4}
This layer of the toolkit contains classes and methods built upon 
level 3  classes.  These include:  a time averaging component (the 
{\tt Accumulator}) and some simple collective communications 
methods associated with it; representation of sparse matrices 
(the {\tt SparseMatrix}) and matrix-{\tt AttrVect} operations;
a general definition of coordinate grids (the {\tt GeneralGrid});
a general representation of collective data transfer---whether it be 
a transpose or a parallel transfer between pools of processors that 
can be either on the same set of processors or differing sets of 
processors (the {\tt Router}) and communications methods that employ
it; a facility for merging flux and state data from multiple component 
models (design still under discussion); a highest-level, all-encompassing
 class that describes the exchange of data between two component 
models---the {\tt Contract} (design still in progress).
