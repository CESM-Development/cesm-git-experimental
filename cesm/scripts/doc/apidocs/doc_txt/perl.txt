/*! \page perl Perl markup conventions

Perl code documentation uses the Doxygen::Filter::Perl module input filter which is
specified in the Doxyfile configuration file. There are a number of sites
available that demonstrate good documentation markup for Perl code using the /usr/local/bin/doxygen-filter-perl
input filter. They include:

 - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Doxygen-Filter-Perl/lib/Doxygen/Filter/Perl.pm
 - https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/jedicke/MOPS/docs/UsingDoxygenWithPerlForPS1-MOPS.pdf
